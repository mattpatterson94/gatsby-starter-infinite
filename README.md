# Gatsby Starter Mattdoesdev

Get started with GatsbyJS straight away without having to spend a whole day configuring your usual addons.

This starter includes:

* TailwindCSS / PostCSS 
* TypeScript
* ESLint / Prettier Linting
* GraphQL codegen for schema and TypeScript types
* Netlify CMS
* etc...

## Quick Start

1. **Create a Gatsby site**

   Use the Gatsby CLI to get started locally:

   ```sh repo
   npx gatsby new my-site https://github.com/mattpatterson94/gatsby-starter-mattdoesdev
   ```

1. **Configure Gatsby**

   Visit the `gatsby-config.js` file and check out the plugins installed. Some plugins require configuration, such as the Google analytics plugin.

1. **Start developing**

   In your site directory, start the development server:

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

   Your site should now be running at <http://localhost:8000>

1. **Open the source code and start editing**

## Deploy your site

1. Push your local site to a new repo in either GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
1. Log into your [Gatsby Cloud Dashboard][] and click on **Add a site**
1. Use the **Import from a Git repository** option to find your site
1. Add the environment variables from your `.env.production` file to Gatsby Cloud during setup
1. Click **Build site** and your site should start building
